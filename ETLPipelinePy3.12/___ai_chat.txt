[Me] I have a "__main__.py" file within a module called "etl_pipeline_ggn1_ase_g5". This file contains a FastAPI app with a "create_task" route as follows delimited by ```.
```
@app.post("/task/", summary="Create new ETL task.", description="Create a new ETL task, add it to the DB and schedule it.")
def create_task(task_str:str):
    """
    Creates a new ETL task, adds it to the DB and schedules it.
    @param task_str: Base64 encoded byte string of an ETL Task object.
    @return: Response to request.
    """
    response = {'status': 200, 'message': f'', 'data':[]}
    try:
        if SCHEDULER_RUNNING == False:
            start_scheduler()
        print(f'[DEBUG] Task str = {task_str}.')
        task = base64decode_obj(task_str) # Get ETL Task from base64 encoded string.
        print(f'[DEBUG] Got task {task}.')
        DB_MANAGER.create_task(task) # Add task into DB.
        job = task.schedule(schedule=schedule, host=HOST, port=PORT) # Schedule task.
        SCHEDULED_JOBS[task.name] = job # Keep a reference of this scheduled job.
        response['message'] = f"Success. Task created and scheduled {task.name}."
    except Exception as e:
        # delete_task(task.name) # Remove partially correct entered task.
        response['status'] = 400
        logger.error(f'Failure. Could not create task due to "{e}".')
        response['message'] = f'Failure. Could not create task due to "{e}".'
    return response
```

The above function receives a base64 encoded task string as input which is then decoded using the "base64decode_obj" function to get back an ETLTask object. The encode and decode functions are given below delimited by ```.
```
import dill
import base64

def base64encode_obj(obj):
    """
    Retruns this object as a base 64 encoded byte string.
    @param obj: Object to encode.
    @return: Base 64 encoded byte string.
    """
    return base64.b64encode(dill.dumps(obj)).decode('utf-8')

def base64decode_obj(base64str:str):
    """
    Deserializes base 64 encoded byte string.
    @param base64str: Base 64 encoded byte string.
    @return: Object that was encoded in the given string.
    """
    return dill.loads((base64.b64decode(base64str.encode('utf-8'))))
```

My file structure looks like the following delimited by ```.
```
ETLPipeline
  - etl_pipeline_ggn1_ase_g5
    - __init__.py
    - __main__.py
    - etl_db_manager.py
    - etl_task.py
    - utility.py
  - tests
    - test_main.py
  - setup.py
```

My "test_main.py" file contains the following delimited by ```.
```
def test_create_task():
    """ 
    This test checks status of the task creation
    endpoint. Both success and failure case.
    """
    task_success = ETLTask(
        name="task1",
        fun_data_load=load_toy_data,
        fun_data_transform=transform_toy_data,
        fun_data_save=save_toy_data,
        repeat_time_unit='seconds',
        repeat_interval=5
    )
    task_str = base64encode_obj(task_success)
    response = make_post_request(
        url="http://127.0.0.1:8003/task", 
        data={"task_str": task_str}
    ).json()
    print('RESPONSE =', response)
```
When I run "pytest main_test.py", there is an error and the resonse returned is "No module named \'test_main\'.".
If I just run the test_create_task() inside the __name__ == "__main__" clause using command python main_test.py, then this works. Why is this happening. Why does running it using pytest lead to this failure?

[ChatGPT 3.5] ... Check path file ...



[Me] The path to the test file is right. If I run only the following test delimited by ```. It passes.
```
def test_server_running():
    """ This test checks if the server is running. """
    response = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:8003/docs")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```
[ChatGPT 3.5] ... See if imports are correct. Check naming conventions. ...



[Me] There is on naming convention issue. Also, nowhere is there a statement that asks to import "test_main" as this is not a module or directory at all. 

[ChatGPT 3.5] ... Given that the test_server_running() test passes while the test_create_task() test fails with the "No module named 'test_main'" error, it's possible that there might be an issue with how pytest discovers and imports test files. ...

[Me] Is there another way to do unit testing other than using pytest?

[ChatGPT 3.5] Yes ... unittest, nose2, doctest, ...
