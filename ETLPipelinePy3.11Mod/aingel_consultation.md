## PROBLEM: Modularization of Python files. Debugging.

<font color='magenta'>[ME]</font> Following text delimited by ``` is the file structure of my python files that I'm currently working on modularizing. Remember this.
```
- ETLPipeline3.11Mod/
    - etl_pipeline_ggn1_ase_g5
        - __init__.py
        - __main__.py
        - etl_db_manager.py
        - etl_task.py
        - utility.py
```

<font color='magenta'>[ME]</font> Inside my "__main__.py" file, there is a line of code that says ``` from utility import base64decode_obj ```. This seems to trigger an error when I run ``` python -m etl_pipeline_ggn1_ase_g5 --db-name db_etl --db-path ./___test --logs-dir ./___test/logs ```. The error message reads "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utility'". Why does this happen?

<font color='cyan'>[PERPLEXITY]</font> The error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utility'" occurs because the Python interpreter cannot find the module named 'utility' when you run the command `python -m etl_pipeline_ggn1_ase_g5`.

This issue typically arises due to the way Python resolves module imports. When you run a Python script using the `-m` flag followed by a module name, Python treats the directory containing the script as the top-level package. In this case, when you run `python -m etl_pipeline_ggn1_ase_g5`, Python looks for modules relative to the `etl_pipeline_ggn1_ase_g5` package.

To resolve the "ModuleNotFoundError" in this scenario, you have a few options:

1. **Update the import statement in "__main__.py"**:
   - Change the import statement from `from utility import base64decode_obj` to `from etl_pipeline_ggn1_ase_g5.utility import base64decode_obj`. This change specifies the correct path to the `utility` module relative to the package.

2. **Adjust the PYTHONPATH**:
   - You can set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the root directory of your project. This way, Python will search for modules starting from the specified directory.

3. **Use a package-relative import**:
   - Instead of importing `base64decode_obj` directly in "__main__.py", you can import it in a package-relative manner. For example, you can use `from .utility import base64decode_obj` to indicate that the module should be imported relative to the current package.

By implementing one of these solutions, you can ensure that Python can locate and import the 'utility' module correctly when running your script. 

<mark>Suggested solution 3 solveed the problem. The explanation of the cause of this issue was spot on. This prompted research on our end regarding the topic of how imports from and within modules work in python.<mark/>
